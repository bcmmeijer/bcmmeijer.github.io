of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called &quot;plantains&quot;,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.</content><author><name>bmeijer</name></author><summary type="html">A lewd banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</summary></entry></feed>
